Data for Boxplots
```{r}
load("../output/Select Readmission Data.RData")
load("../output/charge.Rda")
charge$Total_charges<-charge$total_discharges*charge$average_covered_charges
total_charge_hos<-tapply(charge$Total_charges,charge$provider_id,sum)

hospital_info<-charge[,2:8]
hospital_info<-hospital_info[!duplicated(hospital_info),]

hospital_info$Charge<-total_charge_hos
```

Define the regions
```{r}
west<-c("WA","OR","MT","ID","WY","CA","NV","UT","CO","AZ","NM","AK","HI")
midwest<-c("ND","MN","SD","NE","IA","KS","MO","WI","IL","MI","IN","OH")
northeast<-c("NY","PA","NJ","CT","MA","RI","VT","NH","ME")
south<-c("TX","OK","AR","LA","MS","MS","AL","TN","KY","WV","MD","DC","DE","VA","NC",
         "SC","GA","FL")
```

```{r}
hospital_info$hospital_region<-rep(NA,nrow(hospital_info))
hospital_info$hospital_region[hospital_info$provider_state %in% west]<-"west"
hospital_info$hospital_region[hospital_info$provider_state %in% midwest]<-"midwest"
hospital_info$hospital_region[hospital_info$provider_state %in% northeast]<-"northeast"
hospital_info$hospital_region[hospital_info$provider_state %in% south]<-"south"
```

Build the boxplots
```{r}
#p1 <- plot_ly(hospital_info[hospital_info$hospital_region == "west",], x = ~Charge, color = ~provider_state, type = "box")
#p1

#p2 <- plot_ly(hospital_info[hospital_info$hospital_region == "midwest",], x = ~Charge, color = ~provider_state, type = "box")
#p2

#p3 <- plot_ly(hospital_info[hospital_info$hospital_region == "northeast",], x = ~Charge, color = ~provider_state, type = "box")
#p3

#p4 <- plot_ly(hospital_info[hospital_info$hospital_region == "south",], x = ~Charge, color = ~provider_state, type = "box")
#p4
```

Data for Map selection

  filter(Measure.Name %in% unique(readmission1$Measure.Name)[7:14]) %>%
  group_by(Measure.Name, provider_state) %>% 
  na.omit()

select$Score<-as.numeric(select$Score)

select<-summarize(select, maxscore=max(Score),avg=round(mean(Score),1),minscore=min(Score))

select$info<-with(select,paste(provider_state,"<br>","Maximum Score:",maxscore,"<br>","Average Score:",avg, "<br>", "Minimum Score:",minscore))
```

Build the map
```{r}
# specify some map projection/options
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)

plot_geo(select[select$Measure.Name=="CABG",], locationmode = 'USA-states') %>%
  add_trace(
    z = ~avg,text = ~info, locations = ~provider_state,
    color = ~avg, colors = 'Oranges'
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Hospital Selection',
    geo = g
  )
```
Data for Data Table
```{r}
 #   data1 <- readmission1
#    data1$Score<- as.numeric(data1$Score)
#    data1<-arrange(data1, desc(Score))
    
```
