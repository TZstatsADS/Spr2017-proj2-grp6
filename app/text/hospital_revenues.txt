One factor contributing to variation in what hospitals charge for common procedures is the concentration of hospitals in a geographic area.  In areas where there are many small hospitals competing for business, prices are likely to be low.  In areas where there are only a few big hospitals, those hospitals enjoy a surplus of pricing power, and they generally charge more.  Some hospitals are chains owned and operated by larger parent organizations.  Mount Sinai in New York City is an example of such a hospital chain.  Although we did not explore any data directly related to hospital group ownership, we can see patterns in the data on hospital charges that reveal the distribution of how large hospitals are in each state by measuring their total charges through the IPSS system.  Look at the Northeast region.  New Jersey is consistently more expensive than New York and Pennsylvania for the same medical procedures.  We also see from the box plots that itâ€™s hospitals are also generally larger in revenue terms.
